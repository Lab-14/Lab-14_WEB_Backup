For compiling pages:

 Move to jemdoc_pages folder
 
 1. Switch to python 2.7 as: conda activate py27
 2. Execute next command as: python jemdoc.py -o ../[space] pagename.jemdoc
 3. see in outside folder the update files. :)
 4. source deactivate for quiting py27

 Recently, there was some issue during compilation. So, I installed phython 3 compatible as mentioned [http://yangfeng.hosting.nyu.edu/post/using-jemdoc-with-python-3-and-new-mac-os/ here]. using this script the updated procedure is, 
  1. Move to jemdoc_pages folder
  2. Run Jemdoc -o ../ pagename.jemdoc
